2) How your single project can evolve step-by-step

You can build one sentiment analysis project in phases.

Phase 1: Classical NLP

Goal: Understand preprocessing and traditional ML.

Steps:

Load dataset

Clean text

Tokenization

Stopword removal

Lemmatization

TF-IDF vectorization

Train Logistic Regression

Phase 2: Word Embeddings

Replace TF-IDF with embeddings.

Steps:

Tokenize text

Use:

Word2Vec

or GloVe

Convert sentences into vectors

Train classifier

Phase 3: Deep NLP

Use neural networks.

Steps:

Tokenize text

Convert words to embeddings

Feed into:

LSTM

or GRU

Phase 4: Modern NLP (Transformers)

Use pretrained models.

Steps:

Use pretrained BERT

Fine-tune on sentiment dataset

Evaluate

3) How to get started with NLP (practical steps)

Yes, you need a dataset, just like any ML project.

But NLP datasets are easier:

Just text + label

Example:

"This movie was amazing" → Positive
"Worst product ever" → Negative

4) Best beginner dataset (for you)

Use:

IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset

Why:

Clean

Balanced

Widely used

Perfect for beginners

Structure:

review_text, sentiment
"I loved the movie", positive
"It was boring", negative

5) Your active-learning project plan

Instead of watching tutorials, follow this self-driven plan.

Day 1: Understand the data

Load dataset

Print 10 reviews

Check class distribution

Ask yourself:

Are reviews long or short?

Are they balanced?

Day 2: Text preprocessing

Implement:

Lowercasing

Tokenization

Stopword removal

Lemmatization

Then compare:

Original text

Cleaned text

Day 3: Convert text to numbers

Try:

Bag of Words

TF-IDF

Then:

Print feature shape

See how text becomes vectors

Day 4: Train first model

Use:

Logistic Regression

Evaluate:

Accuracy

Confusion matrix

Day 5: Improve model

Try:

Naive Bayes

SVM

Compare results.


“What NLP project did you do?”

You can say:

“I built a sentiment analysis system starting with classical NLP using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression. Then I extended it using word embeddings and deep learning models, and finally fine-tuned a transformer model. This helped me understand the evolution of NLP techniques from traditional methods to modern LLM-based approaches.”


When I make bigger project: 
“I chose the IMDb dataset because it’s a standard NLP benchmark with enough data to evaluate classical models, embeddings, deep learning, and transformer-based approaches. It allowed me to study the evolution of NLP techniques on the same problem.”
